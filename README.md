# PersonalFinancesConsoleApp
A little program I made while practicing data structures and OOP. It is a personal finances manager.

## ALPHA 1.0 ##
### What does it mean? ###
The first functional version of my practice console app is ready. Through this program I learn some things about C++:

- Pointers
- Object Oriented Programming
- Data structures
- Header files creation

### Features ###
Although this is a small console app, there are some things that you can do with this program:

- Manage your  *incomes* and *expenses* lists
- Create new lists to organize your finances
- Delete lists
- Edit Lists
- Edit Records

### What is next? ###
For the next version, I want to add a **key feature** to save your lists and manage them whenever you want. Yes, I know that this should be already on, but first I wanted the other features to work, next I'll learn more about file management with C++ and then add that.
